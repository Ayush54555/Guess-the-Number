# Guess The Number

A simple Python game where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. The game gives hints whether the guess is too high or too low until the correct number is guessed.

---

## How It Works

- The program generates a random number between 1 and 100.
- You enter your guess.
- The program tells you whether to guess higher or lower.
- It keeps track of the number of guesses.
- Once you guess correctly, it congratulates you and shows how many attempts you took.
